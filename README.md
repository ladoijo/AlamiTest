## TODO / What will I do when I have more time

This is a really, really, really simple App, there are more parts that could be improved and I want to be added. So here they are:

- Add epic unit test
- Add UI test
- Use one of react native UI kits. Just to make this boring UI become flashy, eye catching, and ofcourse for improving development process.
